# Quick Start Guide - USB Camera on Raspberry Pi

This guide gets your USB camera working with the plant disease app in 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Setup USB Camera (on Raspberry Pi)

```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x server/setup-usb-camera.sh

# Run the setup script
./server/setup-usb-camera.sh
```

This script will:
- Install required packages (`fswebcam`, `v4l-utils`)
- Detect your USB camera
- Test the camera
- Show supported resolutions

## Step 2: Configure Camera Server (on Raspberry Pi)

Create `server/.env` file:

```bash
cd server
nano .env
```

Add this content (adjust resolution if needed):

```env
CAMERA_TYPE=usb
USB_CAMERA_DEVICE=/dev/video0
CAMERA_RESOLUTION=1280x720
```

Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

## Step 3: Install Dependencies (on Raspberry Pi)

```bash
# Install camera server dependencies
cd server
npm install

# Go back to project root
cd ..

# Install app dependencies
npm install
```

## Step 4: Start Camera Server (on Raspberry Pi)

```bash
cd server
npm start
```

**Important:** The server will display your Pi's IP address. Copy it!

Example output:
```
ðŸ“± Remote Access (from mobile phones on same network):
   http://192.168.1.100:3001

ðŸ’¡ Set this in your web app's .env.local:
   VITE_CAMERA_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3001
```

## Step 5: Configure Web App (on Raspberry Pi)

Open a **new terminal** (keep camera server running) and:

```bash
# Create .env.local file
nano .env.local
```

Add this (use the IP address from Step 4):

```env
VITE_CAMERA_SERVER_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3001
```

Replace `192.168.1.100` with YOUR Pi's IP address!

Save and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

## Step 6: Start Web App (on Raspberry Pi)

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will start on port 8080 (or 5173).

## Step 7: Access from Mobile Phone

1. **Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi as the Pi**

2. **Open your phone's browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://192.168.1.100:8080
   ```
   (Replace `192.168.1.100` with your Pi's IP address)

3. **Click "Take Photo"** button - it will use the USB camera connected to the Pi!

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not detected
```bash
# Check if camera is connected
lsusb | grep -i camera

# Check video devices
ls /dev/video*
```

### Camera server won't start
```bash
# Check if port is in use
sudo lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9

# Try again
cd server
npm start
```

### Can't access from phone
1. Verify Pi and phone are on same WiFi
2. Check Pi's firewall:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 3001
   sudo ufw allow 8080
   ```
3. Try pinging the Pi from your phone's browser:
   ```
   http://192.168.1.100:3001/api/health
   ```
   You should see: `{"status":"ok","message":"Camera server is running"}`

### Wrong resolution or camera quality
Edit `server/.env` and try different resolutions:
```env
# Try these resolutions
CAMERA_RESOLUTION=1920x1080  # Full HD
CAMERA_RESOLUTION=1280x720   # HD (recommended)
CAMERA_RESOLUTION=640x480    # VGA
```

Check supported resolutions:
```bash
v4l2-ctl --device=/dev/video0 --list-formats-ext
```

### Multiple cameras
If you have multiple cameras:
```bash
# List all video devices
ls /dev/video*

# Use a different device in server/.env
USB_CAMERA_DEVICE=/dev/video1
```

## Auto-Start on Boot (Optional)

Once everything works, set it up to start automatically:

```bash
# Create camera server service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pi-camera.service
```

Add:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Pi Camera Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/pic-doc-snap/server
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node camera-server.js
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable it:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable pi-camera.service
sudo systemctl start pi-camera.service
```

## Summary

âœ… USB camera detected and tested  
âœ… Camera server running on port 3001  
âœ… Web app configured with Pi's IP  
âœ… Web app running on port 8080  
âœ… Accessible from mobile phones  

Now you can take photos with your Raspberry Pi camera from any mobile phone on the same network! ðŸ“¸
